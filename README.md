# Branches

We work on development branch but **we don't** make changes on it. You will **create new branch** for the task that you assigned yourself.

## Creating a task branch

This is an exapmle to work on for the task1, so you have to change it depending on yours.

```
$ git checkout development

Switches to branch to development

$ git pull origin development

Get all up to date changes from development branch

$ git checkout -b task1 development

Switched to a new branch "task1"

```

## Getting the updates for your branch from development

```
$ git checkout development

Switches to branch to development

$ git pull origin development

Get all up to date changes from development branch

$ git checkout task1

Switches to your working branch

$ git merge development

Merges the updates to your branch
```


## Incorporating a finished task on development

After pushing the code to your own branch you need to make a pull request from the webpage.


**Simply click on branches**
